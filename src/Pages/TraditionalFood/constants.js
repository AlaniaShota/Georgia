export const Supra_Description =
  "While there are many reasons to host a supra, its fundamental elements never change. Along with sharing the impressive amount of food and wine, people share their happiness and respect, as well as console and cheer up one another. The Georgian supra is impressive in its variety: depending on the region and occasion, the sequence of dishes and order of some toasts may differ. As a table can be laid for good times and bad, the menu and the tone can be modified, but the main philosophy behind the event - communal sharing and sitting together for a meal - remains the same. The rules of Georgian supra are set in stone, with several obligatory toasts to be said, which brings us to the role of toastmaster, tamada, and its paramount importance. The toast in the local tradition is a part of the genre of praise and plea, almost a prayer. It is incumbent upon the tamada of a Georgian supra to propose the toasts appropriate for the occasion of the gathering. Phrasing the obligatory ritual messages in a beautiful, poetic way is crucial. That`s why usually the most eloquent and respected attendee of the meal is appointed as the tamada.";

As a proof of it, a bronze figure of a man holding a horn, dating back to the 7th century, was found in the archaeological excavations of Vani (Imereti Region).";
