Each of them is distinguished by its characteristic graphic style. Changes in the Georgian alphabet are defined by various factors occurring over centuries. ";

  "The oldest written sources that have been preserved are from the 5th century. The Bolnisi Sioni Church inscription reads 493-494. Until the 1950s that was considered to be the oldest one. The Italian archaeologist, Virgilio Corbo, discovered the remains of a Georgian monastery with three inscriptions, near Bethlehem, in the Judean Desert, in 1952-1953. Two date back to the first half of the 5th century (428-432). ";

  "In scientific circles, there is still a fundamental disagreement about whether or not Georgians created their writing system much earlier than the 5th century. The Georgian scientist, Ivane Javakhishvili, after a long period of research, concluded that the birth of the Georgian alphabet is to be sought in the pagan, pre-Christian era. ";
export const Scientific_Second_Description =
  "In Greek and Roman sources from the antiquity period, there are multiple mentions of Georgians (Colchians) having a writing system in the pre-Christian era. Examples can be found in historical sources written by Oribasius (2nd century), Apollonius of Rhodes (4th century), and other historians. Professor Ramaz Pataridze shares this view that, based on a graphical analysis of the letter forms of the Georgian Asomtavruli script, Georgian writing is based on Phoenician writing, created by pagan priests at the end of the 5th century BCE.

Due to the shape and contours, it is also called “mrglovani” (meaning “rounded” in Georgian). The most ancient monuments of Georgian writing were written in Asomtavruli, starting in the 5th century.
